# Recipe Web App - EoMA Group A

This is our recipe web app project for our Networks and Web Technology module. It's a full-stack application where users can search for recipes, rate them, save favorites, and manage their accounts.

## What it does

### For Users
- Sign up and log in to your account
- Browse through a collection of recipes
- Search for recipes by name, ingredients, or description
- Filter recipes by category (like vegetarian, vegan, desserts, etc.)
- Rate recipes with 1-5 stars
- Save your favorite recipes
- Set your dietary preferences

### Technical
- Built with PHP backend and vanilla JavaScript frontend
- Uses MySQL database to store everything
- Works on both mobile and desktop
- Real-time search as you type
- Pagination for browsing lots of recipes

## What you need to run this

- **XAMPP** - for Apache, MySQL, and PHP
- **MySQL Workbench** - to manage the database
- **A modern browser** (Chrome works best)
- **Insomnia** (optional) - for testing the API

## How to set it up

### Step 1: Get XAMPP running

1. **Download XAMPP** from [https://www.apachefriends.org/](https://www.apachefriends.org/)
2. **Install it** on your computer
3. **Start XAMPP Control Panel**
4. **Click "Start"** for both Apache and MySQL
5. Make sure both show green status (means they're running)

### Step 2: Put the project in the right place

- Copy the entire project folder to: `C:\xampp\htdocs\` (Windows) or `/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/` (Mac)
- You should be able to access it at `http://localhost/frontend` in your browser

### Step 3: Set up the database

1. **Open MySQL Workbench**
2. **Connect to your local server**:
   - Host: `localhost`
   - Port: `3306`
   - Username: `root`
   - Password: (leave blank - that's the default)

3. **Create the database**:
   - Right-click in the schemas panel
   - Create new schema called `recipe_app_group_a`

4. **Import the data**:
   - Go to Server â†’ Data Import
   - Choose "Import from Self-Contained File"
   - Select `DB/populated_database_EOM.sql`
   - Set the default schema to `recipe_app_group_a`
   - Click "Start Import"

5. **Check it worked** - you should see tables like `users`, `recipes`, `categories`, etc.

### Step 4: Configure the backend

1. **Open** `backend/.env`
2. **Check the database settings** (they should work with default XAMPP):
   ```
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASS=
   DB_NAME=recipe_app_group_a
   ```

### Step 5: Test it out

1. **Open your browser** and go to `http://localhost/`
2. **Try registering** a new account
3. **Browse some recipes** and test the search
4. **Try rating and favoriting** some recipes
